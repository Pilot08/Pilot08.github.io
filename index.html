 <p>respect the beavers </p>
<p> in my opinion the beaver is the stongest mammel in the world at the momment</p> 
<p> The weight of the giant beaver could vary from 90 kg (198 lb) to 125 kg (276 lb). This makes it the largest known rodent in North America during the Pleistocene and the largest known beaver. Recent analyses suggest that they weighed less, closer to 77 kg (170 lb), but this is disputabl</p>

  <p> ts ears, nose, and mouth can also be closed underwater. Beaver can stay underwater for up to 15 minutes due to their ability to efficiently transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream and to tolerate a build-up of carbon dioxide in the body.</p>
    <p>Beavers build dams. ...
    Their front teeth don't stop growing. ...
    Beavers bottoms smell of vanilla. ...
    Beavers can hold their breath underwater for 15 minutes! ...
    Giant beavers existed in the Ice Age! ...
    They slap their tails on the water to warn family members of danger. ...
    Baby beavers are called kits. </p>
    <p>Diet. Leaves, inner bark, and twigs of deciduous trees and shrubs.Beavers have twenty teeth in total, including four incisors at the front – two upper and two lower </P>
<p>Although baby beavers are born with well-developed bodies, open eyes, and erupted teeth, they are still extremely vulnerable. In fact, for the first several weeks, baby beavers stay within the safety of their lodge for several weeks where their mother nurtures and cares for them.also there teeth are orange. </p>

  <p>the beaver is the largest rodent in the world.

<p>The word dinosaur comes from the Greek language. ...
Dinosaurs ruled the Earth for more than 150 million years. ...
Dinosaurs became extinct about 65.5 million years ago. ...
Baby tyrannosaurs were probably abandond by there mum at six moths old. ...
The first dinosaur to be named was the Megalosaurus.</p>




<p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs</p>
